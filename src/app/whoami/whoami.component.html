        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">I'm an honest and ambitious developer with a fundamental interest for a technical career that brings challenges, triumphs and failures to my career and experience. <br><br>
            Strong social skills proven through high customer trust and satisfaction, and a trait of leaving my previous workplaces in a positive atmosphere. <br><br>
            IT & Engineering combined with social interactions are two of my main driving forces that I strive to embed into my career. I highly enjoy being challenged and forced to learn and adapt to new environments and software in order to find optimal solutions and gain experience. 
            <br><br>Thanks to my years of working with a full stack, Iâ€™m proficient in many programming languages and concepts; which further ensures a fast learning-curve if I encounter new systems or stacks.
